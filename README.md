#Assembly Programming Toolkit
Assembly programming toolkit for developers

##Which Assembler Use in Coding?
Netwide Assembler

##Why?
The Netwide Assembler, NASM | <http://www.nasm.us> | , is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler designed for portability (__cross platform__) and modularity

##Use any extra tools for coding?
You don't need any extra tools just need text editor for writing code and terminal for compile and run. But some times I will use SASM (SimpleASM) | <https://dman95.github.io/SASM> | - simple Open Source crossplatform IDE for NASM, MASM, GAS, FASM assembly languages - for easily debugging my codes.
